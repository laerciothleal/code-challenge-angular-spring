### CRUD Application with Angular and Java Spring Framework

This project is a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Angular 17 for the frontend and Java with the Spring Framework for the backend. It demonstrates how to consume REST APIs, display data, and perform various operations on user data.

### Features

- **User Management**: Each user has an ID, first name, last name, and department.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar to find users by name.

Create a sample CRUD application with Angular 17 to consume REST APIs, display, modify, and search user data.

### Running only the frontend, if desired
> Run `ng serve --port 8081` to run without `docker-compose.yml`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/user`.
